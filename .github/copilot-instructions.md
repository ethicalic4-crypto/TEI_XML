# Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents

## Project Overview
This project currently contains only a single file: `test.txt`. There are no source code files, build scripts, or documentation present. The purpose, architecture, and workflows of the project are not yet defined.

## Guidance for AI Agents
- **No codebase structure:** There are no directories or files indicating programming languages, frameworks, or build/test workflows.
- **No project-specific conventions:** No conventions, patterns, or integration points are discoverable at this time.
- **No external dependencies:** There are no references to external libraries, APIs, or services.
- **No documentation:** No README or other instructional files are present.

## Next Steps
- If you add code, documentation, or structure, update this file to reflect new patterns, workflows, or conventions.
- If you know the intended purpose of this project, add a project overview and key goals here.

---

**Example update:**
- If you add a Python script, document how to run it and any dependencies.
- If you add a build system, describe the build/test workflow.
